# Mock Database Structure

This is a **mock database structure** (`db.json`) for demonstration purposes only.

## Important Notes

- This is NOT connected to a real backend or JSON Server
- The data structure shows how the app would work with a real API
- All fetch calls are currently mock/placeholder implementations
- To make this functional, you would need to:
  1. Install JSON Server: `npm install -g json-server`
  2. Run it: `json-server --watch db.json --port 5000`
  3. The app will then connect to `http://localhost:5000`

## Current Status

The app displays hardcoded/static data in the UI. The `db.json` file is provided as a reference for future backend integration.
